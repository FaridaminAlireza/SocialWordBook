# WORDBOOK
The aim of this project is to provide a personalized 
language dictionary within the context of social circles.

This will aid langauge learners to:
- Engage actively in recording and reviewing new words
- Learn from other users of community.


In the context of a language class, this can help students to
learn from each other and aid teachers to keep track of 
students' progress in improving their vocabulary.
